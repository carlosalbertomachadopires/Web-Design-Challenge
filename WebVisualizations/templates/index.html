        <p>The purpose of this project was to analyse how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis , we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities. After assembling the dataset, we used Mataplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trendas and correlations witnessed. </p>
